## Artist Strength Score System

### Core Algorithm Components

#### 1. Engagement Score (40%)
```
Engagement Score = (
  (Play Completion Rate × 0.3) +
  (Replay Rate × 0.25) +
  (Like Rate × 0.2) +
  (Save Rate × 0.15) +
  (Share Rate × 0.1)
) × 100
```

#### 2. Growth Score (30%)
```
Growth Score = (
  (Play Velocity × 0.4) +
  (Unique Listener Growth × 0.3) +
  (Geographic Expansion × 0.2) +
  (Time-based Consistency × 0.1)
) × 100
```

#### 3. Quality Score (20%)
```
Quality Score = (
  (Skip Rate × 0.4) +
  (Retention Rate × 0.3) +
  (Cross-platform Performance × 0.2) +
  (Genre Fit × 0.1)
) × 100
```

#### 4. Potential Score (10%)
```
Potential Score = (
  (Viral Coefficient × 0.5) +
  (Market Position × 0.3) +
  (Demographic Appeal × 0.2)
) × 100
```

### Final Strength Score
```
Artist Strength Score = (
  Engagement Score × 0.4 +
  Growth Score × 0.3 +
